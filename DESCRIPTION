Description: Accomplish high performance simulations in quantitative genetics. 
    The molecular genetic components are represented by R6/C++ classes and methods. 
    The core computational algorithm is implemented using bitsets according to 
    <doi:10.1534/g3.119.400373>. A mix between low and high level interfaces 
    provides great flexibility and allows user defined extensions and a wide range of 
    applications.
